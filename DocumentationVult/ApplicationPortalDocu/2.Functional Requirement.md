The primary requirement is to build a centralized portal website that acts as a gateway to all my custom apps. This portal will require users to create an account, which is essential not only for personalized access but also for managing user data securely. As outlined in my [[1.Idea and Goal]].this platform is designed for both my personal use and for others. With an account, users can store their data—for example, all lists and notes from the to-do list app will be saved and accessible from any device at any time.

The initial suite of apps will include:

- **To-do List App:** Manage tasks and lists.
- **Task Timer:** Keep track of time for various tasks.
- **Note-taking App:** Store and organize notes efficiently.


On the technical side, I plan to use JavaScript as the backend programming language with Deno as the runtime environment. I’m also keen to explore different frameworks, so each app will be built using a distinct framework. This approach will not only enhance the platform’s diversity but also provide valuable learning opportunities. As for DB we're gonna use PostgreSQL which you've already learn about.

For the main portal website, I will use Astro due to its fast load times and overall efficiency, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. The first app to be developed is the to-do list.
Why todo list app, you see man i have a problem of distracting a lot can't focus on a single thing and which cause a lot of problem. So i need to list out things before i do anything which help me a lot. But currently using notepad from window so you know i want to improve that so i think of a todo list idea.

This platform is envisioned as a modular, scalable system where each app integrates seamlessly under a unified user account system, ensuring data is accessible and secure across devices.
