**Technological Requirements for the App Portal:**

- **Programming Language:** JavaScript
- **JavaScript Runtime:** Deno
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Framework:** Astro

**Timeline Estimate:**

The timeline depends on my work schedule and personal commitments. Ideally, the project should take about two weeks to complete—one week dedicated to the UI and one week to the backend. If needed, the project could extend to a maximum of three weeks, but I want to avoid exceeding that. The goal is to complete it within two weeks, with a possible extension to a third week if necessary.

I have attached the flowchart of the app portal in this folder for your review.
